# EigenLayer
EigenLayer Testnet.... Soft on EigenLayer according to this guide. https://teletype.in/@alphahunterss/EigenLayer

> In private_keys.txt, insert privs. The wallets should have test ether in Goerli. (Minimum 0.05)

> In config.py configure sleep and percentage, of ether to be spent.

> pip install -r requirements.txt to console to install dependencies

> Python 3.10+ 

-> The software translates your gETH into rETH and stETH, then throws them into steaking using EigenLayer protocol. We can only pray for retrodrop in the future.
